A basic terminal/command line UI component for React. Extracted from my [personal website](https://wmdmark.com).

Check out the [commands](https://github.com/wmdmark/react-terminal/tree/master/src/commands) module for how to add your own commands.

This probably isn't 100% ready for production. Pull requests welcome.
